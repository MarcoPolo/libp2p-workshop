# libp2p-workshop

Hi there,

Welcome to the libp2p workshop.

We will build a peer-to-peer decentralized chat app using libp2p. Our
application will allow anyone with internet access across the globe to
communicate without depending on any central infrastructure. The workshop will
give hands-on experience on how to build peer-to-peer vs. client-to-server.

## Before the workshop
